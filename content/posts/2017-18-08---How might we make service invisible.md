###[The Ask / ](#the-ask) [The Process / ](#the-process) [The Outcome](#the-outcome)

## The Ask

A large US telco asked frog to re-imagine what the customer experience of 2020. The telco had recently acquired new media assets that increased its competitive offerings and enabled it to offer far greater content to its customers. 

## The Process

The frog team was comprised of interaction designers, visual designers, and strategists. My role included: 
- Lead customer research and synthesis 
- Generate customer journey framework 
- Generate brainstorming and ideation framework
- Contribute to concepting and articulation of signature moments
- Storyboard illustrative animations and narratives for key executives

Our participatory resaerch process included speaking with 25 customers, visiting their homes to understand their painpoints and emergent cusotomer needs. We created several activites to help surface topics during our interviews. One activity included showing customers analogous experiences and asking them to draw parallels to their telco experience.

## The Outcome

We delivered a framework for building trust, a set of 80 different concepts and ideas aligned to this framework, and brought to life a 4 experiences through animated graphics.

### A Framework for Building Trust

A key piece of the roadmap was aligning on a customer driven framework to organize the team around. We created a "Customer Events" framework that oriented the entire organization's implementation effort around key customer events and needs.

Within each event, we also created a framework of objectives, principles and metrics. These provided the quantitative and qualititive guidance for teams working on each Customer Event team. 

### A Collection of Concepts and Ideas Aligned to Core User Needs

Human beings aren’t perfect. Perfection is something that will always elude us. There will always be a small part of humanity in everything we do. No matter how small that part, we should make sure that it transcends the limits of the medium. We have to think about the message first. 

### Key Signature Moments Brought to Life through Rich Animations

Across all Customer Events, frog conceptualized several differentiated signature moments that addressed distinct customer needs that were gathered from primary research. Below is just one example of a signature moment that addressed our need to understand how our energy is used and how the price is calculated.
