###[The Ask / ](#the-ask) [The Process / ](#the-process) [The Outcome](#the-outcome)

## The Ask

In 2018, Australia's leading energy utility approached frog to partner on a major digital transformation journey. With a clear mandate to improve customer experience and customer retention,frog's engagement included in depth customer research, concepting, business case/validation, foundational design and a clear roadmap for implementation.

## The Process

The frog team was comprised of interaction designers, visual designers, strategists and solution architects collaborating on mutliple streams of work to ensure an engagement that balanced business, design and technology requirements. **My role on the team included:**
- Define customer experience framework
- Define criteria for user and business prioritization
- Contribute to interaction and visual design brainstorms and reviews
- Define roadmap metrics, value propositions and functional requirements based on design recommendations
- Facilitate key client workshops and activities 
- Lead business stakeholder interviews
- Collaborate with solution architect on roadmap

Alongside customer interviews, frog facilitated several workshops with our client's internal team to gain alignment around key priorities for the company. This culminated in a two day workshop that gathered nearly 100 people from across the product team to align on customer initiatives for the next planning cycle.

## The Outcome

frog delivered a toolkit of parts that our client could leverage during implementation - from design to development. These included a robust and flexible roadmap/framework, a foundational design language system and component library, and set of differentiated signature moments. 

### A Roadmap Oriented around Customer Needs

A key piece of the roadmap was aligning on a customer driven framework to organize the team around. This framework oriented the organization's implementation effort around key customer events and needs:

Within each event, we also created a framework of objectives, principles and metrics. These provided quantitative and qualititive guidance for each Customer Event product team.

Finally, across all of the Customer Events, we aligned on a set of 40 major Customer Initiatives, gathered from customer research and internal workshops, to be completed in the next 12 months. For each Customer Initiative, we created a Market Requirements Document that described the initiative at a high level. Implementation teams would then further breakdown the technical, functional requirements to deliver on the Customer Initiative's goals.

### Signature Customer Experiences 

Across all Customer Events, frog generated several differentiated signature moments that addressed distinct customer needs synthesized from primary research. Below is just one example of a signature moment that addressed the need for understanding energy usage.

Helping customers understand their energy usage and how that impacts their bill is not only a driver of NPS but also creates significant operational cost/support savings to the company. We hypothesized that if people understand their energy usage through greater contextualization and transparency, they will trust their utility more and are also more likely to take action on reducing their energy footprint.
