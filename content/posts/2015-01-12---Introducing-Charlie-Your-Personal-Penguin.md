##[The Ask / ](#the-ask) [The Process / ](#the-process) [The Outcome](#the-outcome)

## The Ask

[Charlie Finance](https://www.hicharlie.com), a Series A startup approached frog for a brand/product/marketing engagement for a financial assistant chatbot that users interacted exclusively over text or Facebook messenger.

## The Process

The frog team was comprised of interaction designers, visual designers, and copywriters and my role included:

- Facilitation of key client alignment and reviews
- Contribute to Interaction model conceptualization and signature moments
- Contribute to AI relationship model
- Marketing and storytelling narrative for landing page
- Social media headlines and copywriting 
- Brand/character development and origin story

During our discovery phase, the team looked to several areas of inspiration - from animals to robots to abstract chat bubbles:

As part of our divergence process, we created three brand directions that included sample marketing copy, sample visual identities and sample brand strategic directions:

## The Outcome

We ultimately selected a robotic penguin mascot because of its innate friendly demeanor, its loyalty, and intelligence. We also conducted several quantitative A/B tests to assess the penguin's performance relative to other identity/brand strategic directions.

### Landing on A Day in the Life of Charlie

The core concept of the marketing landing page of Charlie was to show Charlie in action. As the user scrolls through the page, you see potential scenarios that Charlie can help with - from acting like an investigator to help you reduce your bills to guarding your bank account against extra charges. We gave Charlie a symbolic set of tools to represent all he could do for his customers.
