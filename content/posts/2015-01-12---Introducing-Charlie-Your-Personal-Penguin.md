###[The Ask / ](#the-ask) [The Process / ](#the-process) [The Outcome](#the-outcome)

## The Ask

[Charlie Finance](https://www.hicharlie.com), a Series A startup approached frog for an integrated product-brand-marketing engagement for a financial assistant chatbot that users interacted exclusively over text and Facebook messenger.

## The Process

The frog team was comprised of interaction designers, visual designers, and copywriters. **My role included:**
- Engagement scoping, planning, contracting, and investment execution
- Marketing and storytelling narrative for landing page
- Brand/character development and origin story
- Contribute to Interaction model conceptualization and on-boarding
- Facilitation of key client alignment and reviews
- Social media headlines and copywriting 

### Integrating Product, Brand & Marketing for a Cohesive Experience

During our brand and characater identity discovery phase, the team looked to several areas of inspiration - from animals to robots to abstract chat bubbles:

As part of our exploration process, we created three brand directions that included sample marketing copy, visual identities and brand strategic directions:

## The Outcome

We selected a robotic penguin mascot because of its innate friendly demeanor, its loyalty, and intelligence. We tailored the penguin to visually demonstrate its intelligence with several details including its delightful antennae and dot matrix belly. We also conducted several quantitative A/B tests to assess the penguin's performance relative to other identity/brand strategic directions.

### Landing on a Day in the Life of Charlie

We designed the Charlie marketing landing page to feel like you were engaging with Charlie the instant the page loaded. As the user scrolls through the page, you see potential scenarios that Charlie can help with - from acting like an investigator to help you reduce your bills to guarding your bank account against extra charges.

### From Financial Assistant to Your Own Personal CFO

We also created a framework that showed how Charlie's relationship with users could evolve and grow over time as users began to trust Charlie with more sensitive financial tasks. We created criteria of key events and actions that quantified the strength of the relationship and upon reaching certain milestones, Charlie would release new functionality.
