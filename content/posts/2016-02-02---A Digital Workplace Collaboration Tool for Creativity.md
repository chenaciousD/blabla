###[The Ask / ](#the-ask) [The Process / ](#the-process) [The Outcome](#the-outcome)

## The Ask

A Series B-funded, touchscreen technology provider asked frog to translate its compelling technology capabilities into a collaboration product for the digital workplace.

## What are the modes and types of collaboration?

We started with the questions: how do teams collaborate? what collaboration use cases are most under-served? Based on primary qualitative resaerch, we identified 4 collaboration typologies and use cases to frame our opportunities. Each of these collaboration use cases required different types of features and interaction models.

We then translated our findings into a opportunity matrix to help frame our brainstorming and positioning.

### Concepting for Collaboration

From there, we created 3 conceptual directions, Concierge, Portal and Campfire - each different product directions designed for different collaboration use cases. 

For each concept, we created sample positioning, sample customer types, and key signature features that created differentiation for that particular concept.

Based on a down selection process, we identified Portal as the concept to move forward with and further refined/developed the interaction model, signature experiences, and industrial design. The project is still under development.
