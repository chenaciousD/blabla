###[The Ask / ](#the-ask) [The Process / ](#the-process) [The Outcome](#the-outcome)

## The Ask

A Series B-funded, touchscreen technology component provider asked frog to translate its compelling technology capabilities into a digital collaboration product for the modern workplace. At the time Microsoft had just launched Surface Hub. Our client's technology had the capability to offer a radically more affordable alternative.

## What are the modes and types of collaboration?

We started with two questions: how do teams collaborate? what types of collaboration are most under-served by existing solutions?

We spent time observing teams across organizations of all sizes and types and based on this research, we identified four collaboration typologies and use cases to frame our brainstorming.

This opportunity matrix served as a useful frame to pull apart ouf concepts to create distinct concepts that were tailored for specific collaboration use cases.

### Concepting for Collaboration

From there, we created 3 conceptual directions, **Concierge, Portal and Campfire**. For each concept, we created sample positioning, sample customer types, and key signature features that created differentiation for that particular concept.

Based on a down selection process, we identified Portal as the concept to move forward with and further refined/developed the interaction model, signature experiences, and industrial design. **This project is still under development.**
