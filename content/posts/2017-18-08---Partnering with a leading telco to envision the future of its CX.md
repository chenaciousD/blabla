###[The Ask / ](#the-ask) [The Process / ](#the-process) [The Outcome](#the-outcome)

## The Ask

A leading US telco asked frog to envision the company's end to end customer experience for 2020. The telco had recently acquired new media/content assets that increased its competitive advantage, enabling it to offer a full suite of products and content to customers.

## The Process

The frog team was comprised of interaction designers, visual designers, and strategists. **My role on the team included:**
- Lead customer research and synthesis of findings
- Generate customer journey framework 
- Generate brainstorming and ideation framework for new product/experience features
- Business case validation
- Contribute to concepting and articulation of signature moments
- Narrative creation and storyboarding for animated graphics 

Our participatory design research process included speaking with 25 customers, visiting their homes to understand their painpoints and emergent customer needs. We created several activites to help surface topics during our interviews. One activity included showing customers analogous experiences and asking them to draw parallels to their own experience.

## The Outcome

A key insight from our customer research was the lack of trust between consumers and the telco brand. Consumers felt that they had a very adverserial relationship with the brand and as a result, viewed all actions taken with suspicion. We delivered a framework to rebuild trust with consumers, a set of experience principles, 80+ differentiated concepts and ideas aligned to this framework, and brought to life two high potential experiences through animated graphics with voiceovers (see below for example).

### A Framework & Service Principles for Building Trust

We created a framework for building trust with different segments of behavioral archetypes: the Independent, the Control Seeker, the Attention Seekr and Delegator. We synthesized the core painpoints that created this distrust and converted them into feature-oriented opportunity areas for the brand's product and customer experience.

### A Collection of Concepts and Ideas Aligned to Core User Needs

We applied the Trust framework, Customer Journey Map (Learn-Buy-Get-Use-Pay-Service) and behavioral archetypes to generate and organize hundreds of concepts and ideas. Below are the concepts organized by Customer Journey and sample archetype:

### Key Signature Moments Brought to Life through Rich Animations

In collaboration with the client, we selected a few high potential ideas that were more easily implementable in the short-term. We brought these to life through animated shorts. The below is one of the final animations that showcases a new personalized, telco bundle selector tool that helps customers find the right services through a highly responsive, friendly interface.
