###[The Ask / ](#the-ask) [The Process / ](#the-process) [The Outcome](#the-outcome)

## The Ask

A leading US telco asked frog to envision the company's end to end customer experience for 2020. The telco had recently acquired new media assets that increased its competitive offerings and enabled it to offer greater content to its customers. 

## The Process

The frog team was comprised of interaction designers, visual designers, and strategists. My role included: 
- Lead customer research and synthesis of findings
- Generate customer journey framework 
- Generate brainstorming and ideation framework for new product features
- Business case validation
- Contribute to concepting and articulation of signature moments
- Storyboard illustrative animations and narratives for key executives

Our participatory design research process included speaking with 25 customers, visiting their homes to understand their painpoints and emergent cusotomer needs. We created several activites to help surface topics during our interviews. One activity included showing customers analogous experiences and asking them to draw parallels to their own experience.

## The Outcome

A key insight from our customer discovery research was the lack of trust between consumers and the telco brand. Consumers felt that they had a very adverserial relationship with the brand and as a result, viewed all actions taken, suspiciously. We delivered a framework on how to rebuild trust with consumers, a set of service/experience principles,  80 different concepts and ideas aligned to this framework, and brought to life a two high potential ideas through animated graphics (see below for example)

### A Framework & Service Principles for Building Trust

Based on primary research, we delivered a framework for building trust with different segments of behavioral archetypes: the Independent, the Control Seeker, the Attention Seekr and Delegator.

### A Collection of Concepts and Ideas Aligned to Core User Needs

We used the Trust framework, Customer Journey framework (Learn-Buy-Get-Use-Pay-Service) and our archetypes to generate and organize hundreds of concepts and ideas. Below are the concepts organized by the journey and trust framework:

We also aligned our concepts against the needs of each archetype:

### Key Signature Moments Brought to Life through Rich Animations

In collaboration with the client, we identified a few high potential ideas that were more easily implementable in the short-term. We brought these to life through motion graphics and voice overs. The below is one of the final animations that showcases a new personalized, telco bundle selection tool that helps customers find the right services.
