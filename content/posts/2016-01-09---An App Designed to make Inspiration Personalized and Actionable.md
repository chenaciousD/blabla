###[The Ask | ](#the-ask) [The Process | ](#the-process) [The Outcome](#the-outcome)

## The Ask

[Inspo](https://insponetwork.com), a Series A startup, approached frog to design and build a new social media lifestyle app tailored for women. Inspo saw an opportunity to create a closer relationship between social media influencers/creators and their fans. frog designed and launched this app to the Appstore in approximately six months, leveraging onshore and offshore resources including a fullstack engineering team.

## The Process

The frog team was comprised of interaction designers, visual designers, technical architect/lead, scrum master, and mobile/backend/QA/devops engineers. **My role on the team included:**
- Scoping, contracting and engagement account leadership
- Product requirements gathering and prioritization
- Design-Engineering collaboration and process definition and model
- Contribute to task sequencing and overall project/product management 
- Contribute to interaction model brainstorming and development

### Start with Inspiration

During immersion, the team spent time looking at direct competitors and analogous offerings (e.g., Spotify, Pinterest) to explore different ways consumers find, organize, and act on inspiration.

We took particular inspiration from prior generations of influencer media and commerce channels such as TV networks/magazines and QVC.

### Design Opportunities for Inspiration

We synthesized our learnings from immersion into a few opportunity areas:

**Curation** - *How might we enable consumers to curate their own inspiration?*

**Discovery** - *How might we design an inspiring experience for discovery and serendipity?*

**Direct Connection** - *How might we enable a deeper connection between creator and consumer?*

**Action** - *How might we motivate consumers to act on their inspiration?*

These opportunities served as the foundational user jobs for the core interaction model and navigation:

### Creating an Efficient Design-Engineering Process

Given the very short timeline, we scoped a phased engagement that maximized design and engineering productivity without sacrificing quality and innovation. **During each phase, we employed a different process and collaboration model to provide for adequate exploration, client feedback and the appropriate level of design/engineering asset fidelity:**

At the end of Phase 2, the frog design and engineering team gathered with key executives from Inspo and **translated all of the features generated during design foundations into Agile Epics and User Stories.** Based on a set of criteria, we created **several tiers of prioritization.** 

The team conducted a full day workshop to **estimate, size and define** over 100 stories that we sequenced into a draft product backlog and implementation plan, with the goal of **parallelizing** efforts where possible in order to maximize productivity and team leverage:

Once we entered the Design-Build sprints, we aligned on staggered design-engineering sprint process.

To ensure transparency and synchronization between the design and engineering teams, we created both design and engineering kanban boards so that each team knew what each other were working on. 

We also created decision making frameworks and gates to minimize cycle time where possible.

**Dual Track Design & Engineering Kanban Approach**

At the end of each engineering sprint, we always completed a **sprint retrospective** to further streamline the process and maximize velocity.

## The Outcome
