###[The Ask / ](#the-ask) [The Process / ](#the-process) [The Outcome](#the-outcome)

## The Ask

[Inspo](https://insponetwork.com), a Series A startup, approached frog to design and build a new social media lifestyle app tailored for women. Inspo saw an opportunity to create a closer relationship between social media influencers/creators and their fans. frog designed and launched this app to the Appstore in approximately 7 months, leveraging a onshore and offshore design and fullstack engineering resources. 

## How do we get inspired and motivate action?

During the first couple of days, we spent time looking at direct competitors and analogous offerings ....

The center of the Inspo experience would revolve around Creator's aggregate channel.

A Highly Curated Channel for Every Creator

## A Navigation with Multiple Paths to Inspiration

**Curation**
*How might we enable consumers to curate their own personal collection of inspiration?*

**Discovery**
*How might we design an inviting interface for discovery and serendipity?*

**Access**
*How might we enable a deeper connection between creator and consumer through direct access?*

**Action**
*How might we motivate consumers to act on their personal inspiration?*

## Creating an Efficient Design-Engineering Process

Given the very short timeline, we created a process that maximized design and engineering productivity:

Throuhg multiple workshops and collaborative brainstorms, we arrived an MVP engineering scope of work in Week 5 of the engagement. At frog's studio in SF, we held a daylong prioritization and sizing workshop to estimate the overall body of engineering work to be completed for MVP.

Once we entered the Design-Build sprints, we aligned on a dual track AGILE development, staggered sprint process. To ensure transparency and synchornicitiy between the design and engineering teams, we created two kanban boards so that each team knew what each other were working on.

This ensured that design and engineering time were maximized and there were limited spinning and cycles. There was a strick process through which client feedback was incorporated prior to engineering investment in order to minimize wasting engineering resources.

We monitored velocity and engineering progress through a bespoke and dynamic Google Sheets velocity tracker.

## The Outcome

Launched in the app store.
