## The Ask

**Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique** senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Vestibulum tortor quam, feugiat vitae, ultricies eget, tempor sit amet, ante. Donec eu libero sit amet quam egestas semper. *Aenean ultricies mi vitae est.* Mauris placerat eleifend leo. Quisque sit amet est et sapien ullamcorper pharetra. 

## What are the modes and types of collaboration?

Based on primary qualitative resaerch, we identified 4 collaboration typologies and use cases to frame our opportunities. Each of these collaboration use cases required different types of features and interaction models.

We then translated our findings into a opportunity matrix to help frame our brainstorming and positioning.

### Concepting for Collaboration

From there, we created 3 conceptual directions, Concierge, Portal and Campfire - each different product directions designed for different collaboration use cases. 

For each concept, we created sample positioning, sample customer types, and key signature features that created differentiation for that particular concept.

Based on a down selection process, we identified Portal as the concept to move forward with and further refined/developed the interaction model, signature experiences, and industrial design.
