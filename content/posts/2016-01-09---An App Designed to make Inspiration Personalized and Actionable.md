###[The Ask / ](#the-ask) [The Process / ](#the-process) [The Outcome](#the-outcome)

## The Ask

[Inspo](https://insponetwork.com), a Series A startup, approached frog to design and build a new social media lifestyle app tailored for women. Inspo saw an opportunity to create a closer relationship between social media influencers/creators and their fans. frog designed and launched this app to the Appstore in approximately 7 months, leveraging onshore and offshore resources including a fullstack engineering team based in Ukraine.

## The Process

The frog team was comprised of interaction designers, visual designers, software architects, scrum master, mobile/backend/QA and devops engineers. **My role on the team included:**
- Scoping, contracting and engagement account leadership
- Product requirements gathering and prioritization
- Interaction model brainstorming and development
- Design-Engineering collaboration and process model
- Facilitation of key client meetings

### Start with Inspiration

During immersion, the teae spent time looking at direct competitors and analogous offerings (e.g., Spotify, Pinterest) to explore different ways consumers find, organize, and act on inspiration.

We took particular inspiration from older generations of media such as TV networks/magazines and the Home Shopping Network.

### Inspiration Opportunities

We synthesized our learnings from immersion into a few opportunity areas around inspiration. These the guiding principles to the core elements of the mobile application.

**Curation**
* - How might we enable consumers to curate their own personal collection of inspiration?*
- High quality, hand-picked by Inspo content team
- Easily personalize curation by category and creator tags

**Discovery**
* - How might we design an inviting interface for discovery and serendipity?*
- Dynamic, parallax interface 
- New trends organized by collection and creator

**Access**
* - How might we enable a deeper connection between creator and consumer through direct access?*
- Direct access to followed creator and category channels
- Each Creator gets their own channel that aggregates from multiple content sources

**Action**
* - How might we motivate consumers to act on their personal inspiration?*
- Save your inspirations and sparks
- Go beyond saving by transacting via "shoppable posts"

The final nav and overall interaction model supports these use cases:

### Creating an Efficient Design-Engineering Process

Given the very short timeline, we scoped a phased engagement that maximized design and engineering productivity without sacrificing quality and innovation. During each phase, we employed a different process and collaboration model to provide for adequate exploration, client feedback and the right level of design/engineering asset fidelity:

At the end of Phase 1 and 2, the frog design and engineering team gathered with key executives from Inspo and translated all of the features generated during design foundations into Epics and Agile User Stories. Based on a set of criteria, we created several tiers of prioritization. 

The team conducted a full day workshop to estimate, size and define over 100 stories that we then sequenced into a draft product backlog and implementation plan, with the goal of **parallelizing** efforts where possible in order to maximize productivity and team leverage:

Once we entered the Design-Build sprints, we aligned on a **dual track agile development process** with design and engineering teams staggered by one week. To ensure transparency and synchornicitiy between the design and engineering teams, we created design *and* engineering kanban boards so that each team knew what each other were working on. We also created decision making frameworks and milestones to minimize cycle time particularly during the detailed design phase where the time and effort were less:

**Dual Agile Kanban Approach**

At the end of each engineering sprint, we always completed a retrospective to further streamline the process and maximize velocity.

## The Outcome

The Inspo App is available for download on the app store [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/inspo-network-find-your-joy/id1455671203).
