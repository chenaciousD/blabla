###[The Ask | ](#the-ask) [The Process | ](#the-process) [The Outcome](#the-outcome)

## The Ask

[Inspo](https://insponetwork.com), a Series A startup, approached frog to design and build a new social media lifestyle app tailored for women. Inspo saw an opportunity to create a closer relationship between social media influencers/creators and their fans. frog designed and launched this app to the Appstore in approximately six months.

## The Process

The frog team was comprised of interaction designers, visual designers, a technical architect/lead, scrum master, and mobile/backend/QA/devops engineers. **My role on the team included:**
- Scoping, contracting and engagement account leadership
- Gathering, documenting and prioritizing product requirements and tradeoffs
- Design-Engineering collaboration and process definition and model
- Contribute to task sequencing and overall project/product management 
- Contribute to interaction model brainstorming and development

#### Getting Inspired by Oprah

During immersion, the team spent time looking at direct competitors and analogous offerings (e.g., Spotify, Pinterest) to explore different ways consumers find, organize, and act on inspiration.

We took particular inspiration from prior generations of influencer media and commerce channels such as TV networks/magazines and QVC.

####  Inspiration Opportunity Areas

We synthesized our learnings from immersion into a few opportunity areas:

**Curation** - *How might we enable consumers to curate their own inspiration?*

**Discovery** - *How might we design an inspiring experience for discovery and serendipity?*

**Connection** - *How might we enable a deeper connection between creators and consumers?*

**Action** - *How might we motivate consumers to act on their inspiration?*

These opportunities served as the foundational user needs that guided the design of the interaction model and navigation.

#### Creating an Efficient Design-Engineering Process

We scoped a phased engagement that maximized design and engineering productivity without sacrificing quality and innovation. **During each phase, we employed a different collaboration model to provide for adequate exploration, client feedback and appropriate level of asset fidelity:**

At the end of Phase 2, the frog product team gathered with key executives from Inspo and **translated all of the features into Agile Epics and User Stories.** 

The team conducted a full day workshop to **estimate, size and define** over 100 stories that we sequenced into a draft product backlog and implementation plan, with the goal of **parallelizing** efforts where possible:

Once we entered the Design-Build sprints, we aligned on staggered design-engineering sprint process.

To ensure transparency and synchronization between the design and engineering teams, we created dual track kanban boards so that everyone knew what each other was working on.

## The Outcome

The Inspo App is available for download on the app store [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/inspo-network-find-your-joy/id1455671203).
