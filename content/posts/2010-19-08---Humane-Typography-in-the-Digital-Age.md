## The Ask

In 2017, Australia's leading energy utility approached frog to partner on a major digital transformation journey. With a clear mandate to improve customer experience and customer retention, frog's engagement included in depth customer research, concepting, foundational design and a clear roadmap for implementation.

## The Process

The frog team was comprised of interaction designers, visual designers, strategists and solution architects collaborating on mutliple streams of work to ensure an engagement that balanced business, design and technology requirements and understanding. 

The team completed several qualitative interviews using design research methods including participatory design.

Alongside customer interviews, frog facilitated several workshops with AGL's internal team to gain alignment around key priorities for the company. This culminated in a two-day workshop that gathered nearly 100 people from across the product team to align on customer initiatives for the next planning cycle.

## The Outcome

Human beings aren’t perfect. Perfection is something that will always elude us. There will always be a small part of humanity in everything we do. No matter how small that part, we should make sure that it transcends the limits of the medium.
