## The Ask

Charlie Finance is a xxXX.

## The Process

The frog team was comprised of interaction designers, visual designers, strategists and industrial designers collaborating on mutliple streams of work to conceive a concept that was differenitated, on brand and a radical departure from the status quo. 

My Specific Role Included:
- Millennial consumer target research 
- Interaction model conceptualization
- Relationship model conceptualization 
- Signature moment and conceptual direction storytelling
- Facilitate key client workshops and activities
- Car-driver narrative and AI personality definition

During our discovery phase, the team looked to several areas of inspiration which included filmes, movies, startups, and new technology capabilities.

We created eight movie poster concepts, each narrative was based on different types of relationships that could inspire different types of car and driver relationships and interactions.

### Multi-modal Interaction Model

Nature vs Nurture inspired the final interaction model which was a disembodied "AI" that was able to move across the car in an almost spirit like fashion. A core

### A Set of Differentiated Signature Moments

Based on the Nature vs Nurture concept direction, we generated several signature moments and ideas that would express the essence of the concept. Below are a few of these concepts that were ultimately brought to life in the final prototype:

In 2017, our client launched the concept at [CES](https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/4/14169960/toyota-concept-i-artificial-intelligence-yui) where it was awarded a Best of CES.
