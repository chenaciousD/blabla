## The Ask

"Creator, an SF based startup disrupting the fast food industry asked frog to design a mobile ordering and burger customization application that showcased the power of its revolutionary machine."

## The Process

The frog team was comprised of interaction designers, visual designers, strategists and solution architects collaborating on mutliple streams of work to ensure an engagement that balanced business, design and technology requirements and understanding.

The team completed several qualitative interviews using design research methods including participatory design.

Alongside customer interviews, frog facilitated several workshops with AGL's internal team to gain alignment around key priorities for the company. This culminated in a two-day workshop that gathered nearly 100 people from across the product team to align on customer initiatives for the next planning cycle.

Alongside customer interviews, frog facilitated several workshops with AGL's internal team to gain alignment around key priorities for the company. This culminated in a two-day workshop that gathered nearly 100 people from across the product team to align on customer initiatives for the next planning cycle.

## The Outcome

frog delivered a holistic toolkit of parts that AGL could leverage during implementation. These included a robust and flexible roadmap/framework, a foundational design language system and component library, and set of differentiated signature moments. 

### A Roadmap and Framework for Orienting Around Customer Needs

A key piece of the roadmap was aligning on a customer driven framework to organize the team around. We created a "Customer Events" framework that oriented the entire organization's implementation effort around key customer events and needs.

Within each event, we also created a framework of objectives, principles and metrics. These provided the quantitative and qualititive guidance for teams working on each Customer Event team.

Finally, across all of the Customer Events, we aligned on a set of 40 major Customer Initiatives to be impleeted in the next 12 months. Each Customer Initiative was given a tear sheet the described the Initiative at a high level. Implementation teams would then further breakdown the technical, functional requirements to deliver on the Customer Initiative.

The frog and AGL team created this roadmap through several iterations and workshops. Ultimately it served as a framework to organize, align and prioritize effort. It also was designed to evolve with the organization after our engagemnet was complete.

### A Foundational Design Language System

Human beings aren’t perfect. Perfection is something that will always elude us. There will always be a small part of humanity in everything we do. No matter how small that part, we should make sure that it transcends the limits of the medium. We have to think about the message first. 

### A Set of Differentiated Signature Moments

Across all Customer Events, frog conceptualized several differentiated signature moments that addressed distinct customer needs that were gathered from primary research. Below is just one example of a signature moment that addressed our need to understand how our energy is used and how the price is calculated.
