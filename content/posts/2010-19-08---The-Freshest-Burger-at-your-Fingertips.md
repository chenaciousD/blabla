###[The Ask | ](#the-ask) [The Process | ](#the-process) [The Outcome](#the-outcome)

## The Ask

[Creator](http://creator.rest), an SF-based startup attempting to disrupt the industrialized food system, asked frog to design a mobile ordering and burger customization app that showcased its revolutionary machine. (Note: The machine itself was designed by noted automotive designer, Per Selvaag).

## The Process

The frog team was comprised of interaction designers, visual designers and strategists who collaborated to design the MVP version of Creator's mobile ordering app. **My role on the team included:**
- Facilitation of key client workshops and alignment
- Gather, document, and prioritize key product requirements
- Copywriting and content strategy
- Contribute to interaction model and signature moments
- Engagement pitching, scoping, contracting, and frogVentures investment documentation 

The team started with a full day kick-off workshop to generate the key features of the mobile experience. We used several frog brainstorming frameworks for this exercise including customer journey mapping and analogous trendscaping:

Given the complexity of the machine, it was important that we create alignment through detailed documentation of the technical functionality of the machine, user needs, and business objectvies of the application. This created an efficient process that translated technology and business needs into design requirements. 

Key **business objectives** included: seamless meal creation, burger customization and elevating taste uniqueness through a flavor-forward content and menu strategy.

Part of our design process also included creating **behavioral archetypes to orient the interaction model around** around critical user goals.

## The Outcome

frog designed the core experience of the MVP mobile app that is currently being used by Creator's own burger concierge staff within the restaurant. **Every element of the app - from the navigation to the persistent smart cart - was designed to maximize user delight and deliver business goals.**

#### Creating an Interaction Model that delivers on User Delight and Business Objectives

The three tab navigation - profile, featured meal menu, and ala carte menu are designed to directly facilitate the needs of our three  archetypes: the efficiency maximizer, the explorer and the burger tinkerer.

####  Filter your Way to the Perfect Burger

For the burger tinkerers, we also created a tactile interaction "filtering" experience that visualizes, real-time, their personalized burger. For every burger element from pattie doneness to # of pickles to sauce proportion - users can tap, toggle, and slide their way to burger perfection.

####  Marketing Freshness, Ingredient Quality and Culinary Creativity

Lastly, we delivered a set of marketing templates including the landing page with key marketing copy and photography assets of the machine, ingredients and burgers. We also produced a two day photo shoot with noted commercial food photographer, [Aubrie Pick](https://aubriepick.com).
