## The Ask

[Creator](http://creator.rest), an SF based startup disrupting the fast food industry asked frog to design a native iOS mobile ordering and burger customization application that showcased the power of its revolutionary machine. 

## The Process

The frog team was comprised of interaction designers, visual designers and strategists who collaborated over a period of 10 weeks to design the MVP version of Creator's mobile ordering app. My role on the team included:

- Key client workshop facilitation and alignment meetings
- Product requirements documentation
- Copywriting and content strategy
- Contribute to interaction model and signature moments
- Engagement contracting, scoping and investment documentation

The team started with a full day kick-off workshop to flesh out the key features and requirements of the mobile experience. We used several frog brainstorming frameworks for this exercise including customer journey mapping and persona mapping:

Given the complexity of the machine and its advanced features, we aligned through substantial documentation on what were the technical functionality requirements, user needs, and business objectvies of the application.

Key business objectives were seamless meal creation, burger customization and a content strategy that highlights some of the distinct flavor profiles of Creator's unique burgers.

### An Interaction Model Tailored for All Burger Lovers

The three tab navigation - profile, featured meal menu, and ala carte menu are designed to facilitate the three identified archetypes, the efficiency maximizer, the explorer and the burger tinkerer. This navigation allows for the speediest path to ordering the freshest burger in the fewest number of taps.

### An Innovative Way to Fine Tune your Perfect Burger

For the burger tinkerers, we also created an delightful and fun interaction "filtering" experience that visualizes, real-time, the chnages to their burger. Each ingredient - pattie, cheese, sauces, meltiness - users can toggle, slide, and [ ] their way to their perfect burger profile. (Note: this functionality has not launched yet).
