## The Ask

Creator, an SF based startup disrupting the fast food industry asked frog to design a mobile ordering and burger customization application that showcased the power of its revolutionary machine. Some of the key objectives were to enable easy meal creation, burger customization and finally highlight some of the distinct flavor profiles of Creator's unique burgers.

## The Process

The frog team was comprised of interaction designers, visual designers and strategists who collaborated over a period of 10 weeks to design the MVP version of Creator's mobile ordering app.

The team started with a full day kick-off workshop to flesh out the key features and requirements of the mobile experience. We used several frog brainstorming frameworks for this exercise including customer journey mapping and persona mapping.

By synthesizing our initial brainstorm, we were able to arrive at a prioritzied scope of design work, bucketed into sprints. We applied the Kano, prioritization framework in order to identify which features were in or out for the MVP experience.

Given the complexity of the machine and the advanced features that it enabled - particularly on the burger customization front - we needed to align through substantial documentation on what were the constraints. Must of this was documentation was also dedicated to detailing out the content hierarchy and taxonomy of Creator's menu - meals, burgers, sides, drinks etc.

## The Outcome

frog delivered a holistic toolkit of parts that AGL could leverage during implementation. These included a robust and flexible roadmap/framework, a foundational design language system and component library, and set of differentiated signature moments. 

### A Roadmap and Framework for Orienting Around Customer Needs

A key piece of the roadmap was aligning on a customer driven framework to organize the team around. We created a "Customer Events" framework that oriented the entire organization's implementation effort around key customer events and needs.

Within each event, we also created a framework of objectives, principles and metrics. These provided the quantitative and qualititive guidance for teams working on each Customer Event team.

Finally, across all of the Customer Events, we aligned on a set of 40 major Customer Initiatives to be impleeted in the next 12 months. Each Customer Initiative was given a tear sheet the described the Initiative at a high level. Implementation teams would then further breakdown the technical, functional requirements to deliver on the Customer Initiative.

### A Foundational Design Language System

Human beings arenâ€™t perfect. Perfection is something that will always elude us. There will always be a small part of humanity in everything we do. No matter how small that part, we should make sure that it transcends the limits of the medium. We have to think about the message first. 

### A Set of Differentiated Signature Moments

Across all Customer Events, frog conceptualized several differentiated signature moments that addressed distinct customer needs that were gathered from primary research. Below is just one example of a signature moment that addressed our need to understand how our energy is used and how the price is calculated.
