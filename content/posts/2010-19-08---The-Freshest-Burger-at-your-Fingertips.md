## The Ask

Creator, an SF based startup disrupting the fast food industry asked frog to design a native iOS mobile ordering and burger customization application that showcased the power of its revolutionary machine. 

## The Process

The frog team was comprised of interaction designers, visual designers and strategists who collaborated over a period of 10 weeks to design the MVP version of Creator's mobile ordering app.

My role on the team included:
- Key client workshop facilitation and alignment meetings
- Product requirements documentation
- Copywriting and content strategy
- Contribute to interaction model and signature moments
- Engagement contracting, scoping and investment documentation

The team started with a full day kick-off workshop to flesh out the key features and requirements of the mobile experience. We used several frog brainstorming frameworks for this exercise including customer journey mapping and persona mapping. By synthesizing our initial brainstorm, we were able to arrive at a prioritzied scope of design work, bucketed into sprints.

Given the complexity of the machine and its advanced features, we needed to align through substantial documentation on what were the technical functionality requirements, user needs, and business objectvies in a cohesive way.
