###[The Ask / ](#the-ask) [The Process / ](#the-process) [The Outcome](#the-outcome)

## The Ask

[Creator](http://creator.rest), an SF based startup disrupting the fast food industry asked frog to design a native iOS mobile ordering and burger customization application that showcased the power of its revolutionary machine. (Note: The machine itself was designed by noted automotive designer, Per Selvaag).

## The Process

The frog team was comprised of interaction designers, visual designers and strategists who collaborated over a period of 10 weeks to design the MVP version of Creator's mobile ordering app. **My role on the team included:**
- Key client workshop facilitation and alignment meetings
- Product requirements documentation and prioritization
- Copywriting and content strategy
- Contribute to interaction model and signature moments
- Engagement contracting, scoping and investment documentation

The team started with a full day kick-off workshop to flesh out the key features and requirements of the mobile experience. We used several frog brainstorming frameworks for this exercise including customer journey mapping, persona mapping, and analogous trendscaping:

Given the complexity of the machine and its advanced features, we created alignment through substantial documentation on the technical functionality requirements, user needs, and business objectvies of the application. This created an efficient process that translated technology and business needs into design requirements.

Key business objectives were seamless meal creation, burger customization and a content strategy that highlighted some of the distinct flavor profiles of Creator's unique burgers.

## The Outcome

frog designed the core experience of the MVP mobile application that has since launched and is currently being used by Creator's own burger concierge staff within the restaurant. Every element of the app - from the nav to the persistent smart cart - was designed to maximize user delight and deliver key business goals such as seamless meal creation and burger customization.

### An Interaction Model that Delivers on Delight & Business Objectives

The three tab navigation - profile, featured meal menu, and ala carte menu are designed to directly facilitate the needs of our three identified archetypes, the efficiency maximizer, the explorer and the burger tinkerer. This navigation allows for the speediest path to ordering the freshest burger in the fewest number of taps.

### Fine Tune your Perfect Burger

For the burger tinkerers, we also created an delightful and fun interaction "filtering" experience that visualizes, real-time, their personalized burger. Each ingredient - pattie, # of pickles, sauces, meltiness - users can tap, toggle, and slide their way to burger perfection. (Note: this functionality has not launched yet).

### Marketing Freshness, Ingredient Quality and Culinary Creativity

Lastly, our engagement provided marketing asset templates including elements of the landing page with key marketing copy and photography assets of the machine, ingredients and burgers.
