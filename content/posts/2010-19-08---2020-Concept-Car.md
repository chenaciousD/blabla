## The Ask

In 2016, a Japanese Automaker engaged frog to help reconceptualize what a car for the 21st century could be. In particular, they asked to reimagine what the relationship between a car and driver could feel like based on new advances in artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. The engagmenet focused primarily on the core essence of the concept, interaction model and key signature moments. Several partners were involved in bringing this concept to life which eventually launched publicly in 2017.

## The Process

The frog team was comprised of interaction designers, visual designers, strategists and industrial designers collaborating on mutliple streams of work to conceive a concept that was differenitated, on brand and a radical departure from the status quo. 

My Specific Role Included:
- Millennial consumer target research 
- Interaction model conceptualization
- Relationship model conceptualization 
- Signature moment and conceptual direction storytelling
- Facilitate key client workshops and activities
- Car-driver narrative and AI personality definition

During our discovery phase, the team looked to several areas of inspiration which included filmes, movies, startups, and new technology capabilities.

The team came up with a unique way of expressing distinct concepts through fictional movie posters and narratives that expressed core ideas of each concept. We created eight movie poster concepts, each narrative was based on different types of relationships that could inspire different types of car and driver relationships and interactions.

Two conceptual directions emerged as the top picks: Nature vs. Nurture and Tsundere. Alongside these conceptual directions, we identified key words, images that emotionally expressed the essence of the concept.

## The Outcome

frog delivered a differentiated concept, signature experiences, and an interaction model designed to strengthen the relationship between car and driver over time through shared creation, experiences and care.

### Relationship Learning Model

This relationship model was based on primary resaerch with millennials who stated that discovery and well-being were key motivators for meaning in the 21st century.

### Multi-modal Interaction Model

Nature vs Nurture inspired the final interaction model which was a disembodied "AI" that was able to move across the car in an almost spirit like fashion. A core

### A Set of Differentiated Signature Moments

Based on the Nature vs Nurture concept direction, we generated several signature moments and ideas that would express the essence of the concept. Below are a few of these concepts that were ultimately brought to life in the final prototype:

In 2017, our client launched the concept at [CES](https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/4/14169960/toyota-concept-i-artificial-intelligence-yui) where it was awarded a Best of CES.
