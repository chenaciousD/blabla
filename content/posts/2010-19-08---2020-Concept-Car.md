In 2016, a Japanese Automaker engaged frog to help reconceptualize what a car for the 21st century could be. In particular, they asked to reimagine what the relationship between a car and driver could feel like based on new advancement in artificial intelligence and autonomous driving.

## The Ask

In 2017, Australia's leading energy utility approached frog to partner on a major digital transformation journey. With a clear mandate to improve customer experience and customer retention, frog's engagement included in depth customer research, concepting, foundational design and a clear roadmap for implementation.

## The Process

The frog team was comprised of interaction designers, visual designers, strategists and industrial designers collaborating on mutliple streams of work to conceive a concept that was differenitated, on brand and a radical departure from the status quo. 

Individual Activities Included:
- Millennial consumer target research 
- Interaction model conceptualization
- Relationship model conceptualization 
- Signature moment and conceptual direction storytelling
- Facilitate key client workshops and activities


During our discovery phase, the team looked to several areas of inspiration which included filmes, movies, startups, and new technology capabilities.

The team came up with a unique way of expressing distinct concepts through fictional movie posters and narratives that expressed core ideas of each concept. We created eight movie poster concepts, each narrative was based on different types of relationships that could inspire different types of car and driver relationships and interactions.

Alongside customer interviews, frog facilitated several workshops with AGL's internal team to gain alignment around key priorities for the company. This culminated in a two-day workshop that gathered nearly 100 people from across the product team to align on customer initiatives for the next planning cycle.

## The Outcome

frog delivered a holistic toolkit of parts that AGL could leverage during implementation. These included a robust and flexible roadmap/framework, a foundational design language system and component library, and set of differentiated signature moments. 

### A Roadmap and Framework for Orienting Around Customer Needs

A key piece of the roadmap was aligning on a customer driven framework to organize the team around. We created a "Customer Events" framework that oriented the entire organization's implementation effort around key customer events and needs.

Within each event, we also created a framework of objectives, principles and metrics. These provided the quantitative and qualititive guidance for teams working on each Customer Event team.

Through several rounds of alignment and concept development/iteration, we aligned on two different Japan inspired concepts: Tsundere and Nature versus Nurture. These two concepts served as the foundational jumping off points for additional brainstorming and ideation.

### Relationship Principles

Nature vs Nurture inspired the final interaction model which was a disembodied "AI" that was able to move across the car in an almost spirit like fashion. A core 

### A Set of Differentiated Signature Moments

Based on the Nature vs Nurture concept direction, we generated several signature moments and ideas that would express the essence of the concept. Below are a few of these concepts that were ultimately brought to life in the final prototype:

Human beings aren’t perfect. Perfection is something that will always elude us. There will always be a small part of humanity in everything we do. No matter how small that part, we should make sure that it transcends the limits of the medium. We have to think about the message first.
