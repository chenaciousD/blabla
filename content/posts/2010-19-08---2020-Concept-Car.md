###[The Ask | ](#the-ask) [The Process | ](#the-process) [The Outcome](#the-outcome)

## The Ask

In 2016, a leading Japanese automaker engaged frog to imagine what an AI concept car of the future could feel like by reconceptualizing the relationship between car and driver and leveraging emerging technologies such as AI, autonomous driving and new digital interfaces.

## The Process

The frog team was comprised of interaction designers, visual designers, film/motion animators, mechanical engineers, strategists and industrial designers. **My role on the team included:**
- Millennial consumer research 
- Signature moment and concept development
- Car-driver narrative and AI personality definition
- Interaction and relationship model concept development 
- Facilitation of key client workshops and activities

During immersion, the team looked to several areas of direct and analogous inspiration including movies, startups, and new technology providers:

We also conducted trend analysis of new ways millennials were valuing and experiencing work and life. We made these trends tangible through a physical museum-like installation in our studio:

Fictional movie narratives helped express core ideas of each concept. We created eight movie poster concepts, each with a narrative that was based on different types of relationships that could inspire a car and driver interaction.

Two directions were selected: Nature vs. Nurture and Tsundere (Love-Hate). To further develop these conceptual directions, we created moodboards of evocative words and images that expressed the essence of each concept:

## The Outcome

frog delivered a differentiated concept, signature experiences, and a radical personality-driven interaction model designed to evolve and grow.

#### Relationship Learning Model

Core to the concept was a relationship model based on primary research with millennials who stated that discovery and well-being were key motivators for meaning in the 21st century.

#### A Multi-modal, Decentralized Interaction Model

We developed a radically different interaction model that was able to move across the car in a "fairy" like fashion to "portals" within the interior and exterior of the vehicle.

#### Signature Experiences that Show Relationship Growth

Based on the Nature vs Nurture concept direction, we generated several signature moments that differentiated the concept. Below is one of these signature experiences - **Sign Language** - that ultimately launched at CES in 2017.

Several partners were involved in bringing this concept to life which eventually launched publicly in 2017. In 2017, our client launched the concept at [CES](https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/4/14169960/toyota-concept-i-artificial-intelligence-yui) where it was also given a prestigious Best of CES award. The concept will be a showcase piece for our client at the Tokyo Olympics in 2020.
