###[The Ask / ](#the-ask) [The Process / ](#the-process) [The Outcome](#the-outcome)

## The Ask

In 2016, a leading Japanese automaker engaged frog to reconceptualize the relationship between a car and driver for the 21st century leveraging technologies such as AI, autonomous driving and new modes of HCI.

## The Process

The frog team was comprised of interaction designers, visual designers, film/motion animators, mechanical engineers, strategists and industrial designers. **My role on the team included**:

- Millennial consumer research 
- Signature moment and concept development
- Car-driver narrative and AI personality definition
- Interaction and relationship model concept development 
- Facilitation of key client workshops and activities


During our discovery phase, the team looked to several areas of inspiration which included movies, startups, and new technology providers:

Our research also included trend analysis of key themes that illustrated new ways millennials were valuing and experiencing work and life. We brought this to life for the client through a physical museum installation experience in our studio:

Fictional movie posters and narratives helped express core ideas of each concept. We created eight movie poster concepts, each narrative was based on different types of relationships that could inspire different types of car and driver interactions:

Two conceptual directions emerged as the top picks: Nature vs. Nurture and Tsundere (Love-Hate). Alongside these conceptual directions, we identified key words and images that expressed the essence of each concept:

## The Outcome

frog delivered a differentiated concept, signature experiences, and a radical multi-modal, personality-driven interaction model designed to strengthen the relationship between car and driver over time.

### Relationship Learning Model

Core to the concept was a relationship model based on primary research with millennials who stated that discovery and well-being were key motivators for meaning in the 21st century. This learning feedback loop represented how and why the AI would evolve over time.

### Multi-modal Interaction Model

The final, selected interaction model was a disembodied AI (called Muse) that was able to move across the car in an almost "fairy" like fashion to "portals" within the vehicle and also on the exterior of the car itself.

### A Set of Differentiated Signature Moments

Based on the Nature vs Nurture concept direction, we generated several signature moments that differentiated the concept. Below is one of these concepts - **Sign Language** - that was ultimately brought to life in the final prototype launched at CES.

Several partners were involved in bringing this concept to life which eventually launched publicly in 2017. In 2017, our client launched the concept at [CES](https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/4/14169960/toyota-concept-i-artificial-intelligence-yui) where it was also given a prestigious Best of CES award.
