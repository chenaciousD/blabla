##I collaborate on multidisciplinary teams to discover, design and develop technology-enabled, people-first products.

Thanks for visiting my site! I am an interdisciplinary product and marketing leader based in San Francisco. My professional experiences span finance & investing, design & technology, architecture. I believe in the power of technology and experience design to improve all aspects of life. I combine my experiences in finance/economics and design to bring data driven analysis to qualitative design-led intuition. I graduated from Harvard College, magna cum laude, phi beta kappa where I wrote my [Economics thesis](/media/Pricing-Dynamics-of-Manhattan.pdf) with [Ed Glaeser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Glaeser). Along the way, I also got an MBA at Stanford Graduate School of Business.

### Finance and Investing
From 2008 to 2012, I worked in real estate finance and investing at Morgan Stanley and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. At Morgan Stanley (New York), I helped advise corporates on M&A, equity & debt raises and other asset management activites. I then was an early team member in ADIA's direct real estate platform where I managed direct and indirect fund/asset positions as well as established new joint venture investing programs with top investment manager and developers in the U.S. Clients and partners have included: CalPERs, Cousins, MSREF, Blackstone, Tishman Speyer, PCCP, CIM Group, Apollo Real Estate Advisors, and Colony Capital.

### Architecture, Cities and Space
My professional background also includes substantial experience in and a passion for physical and environmental design. In addition to spending some time at Herman Miller, I also worked on several Future of Workplace and Retail engagements at frog design. In 2010, I interned for [Bjarke Ingels Group](https://www.big.dk) and [KiBiSi](http://kibisi.com/) in Copenhagen serving as chief of staff to the CEO. I'm particularly interested in the experience and economics of space and how it can shape human behavior.
