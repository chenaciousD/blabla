##I collaborate on multidisciplinary teams to discover, design and build technology-enabled products that positively improve the human experience.

Based in San Francisco, I am a hybrid product and marketing leader with professional experiences spanning finance & investing and design & technology. 

I bring quantitative skills, qualitative intuition, and a broad range of multi-disciplinary, cross-industry experiences to teams. I graduated from Harvard College, magna cum laude, *phi beta kappa* where I wrote my [urban economics thesis](/media/Pricing-Dynamics-of-Manhattan.pdf) with [Ed Glaeser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Glaeser). Along the way, I also got an MBA at Stanford GSB. Since graduating from business school, I've worked at [frog design](https://www.frogdesign.com), a global design and strategy consultancy, headquartered in San Francisco.

### Finance and Investing
From 2008 to 2012, I worked in real estate finance and investing at Morgan Stanley Real Estate and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. At Morgan Stanley (New York), I helped advise corporates on M&A, equity & debt raises and other asset management activites. I then joined ADIA, as an early team member on ADIA's direct real estate platform where I managed direct and indirect fund/asset positions as well as established new joint venture investing programs with investment managers and developers in the U.S. Clients and partners have included: CalPERs, Cousins Properties, MSREF, Blackstone, Tishman Speyer, PCCP, CIM Group, Apollo Real Estate Advisors, and Colony Capital.

### Architecture, Cities and Space
My professional background also includes experience in and a passion for physical and environmental design.

In 2010, I interned for [Bjarke Ingels Group](https://www.big.dk) and [KiBiSi](http://kibisi.com/) in Copenhagen serving as chief of staff to the CEO. **I'm particularly interested in the experience and economics of physical space and how it can shape human behavior.**
