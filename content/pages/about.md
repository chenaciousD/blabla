##I collaborate on diverse teams to discover, design and develop products that move the hearts and minds of people. 

Thanks for visiting my site! I am an interdisciplinary product and marketing leader based in San Francisco. My professional experiences span [finance & investing](#finance-and-investing), [design & technology](#design-and-technology), [architecture](#architecture-and-cities). I believe in the power of technology and experience design to improve all aspects of life, professional and personal. Based on my experiences in finance/economics and design, I combine data driven analysis with qualitative intuition in my approach to problem solving. I graduated from Harvard College, *magna cum laude*, *phi beta kappa* where I wrote my Economics thesis with [Ed Glaeser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Glaeser). Along the way, I also got an MBA at Stanford Graduate School of Business.
