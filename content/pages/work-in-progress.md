I love learning and trying new things. Currently, I'm working on a few side projects and would love your feedback on them!

## City Futures Salons 
In 2019, I began hosting inter-disipinary small group salons in collaboration with [Mat Chow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathewchow) at IDEO, [Rebecca Blum](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebecca-blum-b3800323) at Lyft. These gatherings are designed to instigate conversation around the future of cities through the lens of architecture, mobility, community-building, real estate, design, and culture.

Our most recent salon was held in collaboration with [Enorme Studio](https://enormestudio.es) who presented ideas on how to live in smaller spaces through flexible, movable walls & furniture.

## Coding

I've been teaching myself to code recently. I highly recommend [SuperHi](https://www.superhi.com) for a designerly approach to learning front end. I've also taken a few great [udemy classes](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) for backend.

This website was built using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org), which is a static site generator and based on React. I've used [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) to build and deploy and [netlifycms](https://www.netlifycms.org) as a headless CMS.

## Sourdough Bread & Fermentation

I'm also in the process of documenting recent experimentations with sourdough and other types of fermentation. Below a recent attempt at sourdough brioche:

Sadly ... this [article](https://www.eater.com/2018/11/19/18099127/bread-silicon-valley-sourdough-tech-bros-tartine-chad-robertson) is spot on.
