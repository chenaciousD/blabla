In addition my day job, I'm also working on several side projects that I would love your input on!

## Urban Futures Salons 
In 2019, I began hosting  multi-disipinary salons in collaboration with [Mat Chow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathewchow) at IDEO, [Rebecca Blum](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebecca-blum-b3800323) at Lyft, discussing the future of cities through the lens of architecture, mobility, community-building, real estate, design, and culture.

The first salon was held in collaboration with [Enorme Studio](https://enormestudio.es).

## Coding

I've been teaching myself to code recently. I highly recommend [SuperHi](https://www.superhi.com) for front end. I've also taken a few great [udemy classes](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/), which has been great.

This website was built using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org), which is a static site generator and based on React. I've used [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) to build and deploy and[netlifycms](https://www.netlifycms.org) as a headless CMS.
