I love learning and trying new things. Currentnly, I'm working on a few side projects and would love your feedback on them!

## Urban Futures Salons 
In 2019, I began hosting inter-disipinary salons in collaboration with [Mat Chow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathewchow) at IDEO, [Rebecca Blum](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebecca-blum-b3800323) at Lyft, discussing the future of cities through the lens of architecture, mobility, community-building, real estate, design, and culture.

The first salon was held in collaboration with [Enorme Studio](https://enormestudio.es), discussing how to live on smaller spaces through flexible, movable walls.

## Coding

I've been teaching myself to code recently. I highly recommend [SuperHi](https://www.superhi.com) for a designerly approach to learning front end. I've also taken a few great [udemy classes](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) for backend.

This website was built using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org), which is a static site generator and based on React. I've used [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) to build and deploy and [netlifycms](https://www.netlifycms.org) as a headless CMS.
