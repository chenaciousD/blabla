## Dysutopia
In 2019, I began hosting inter-disciplinary small group salons in collaboration with [Mat Chow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathewchow) at IDEO, [Rebecca Blum](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebecca-blum-b3800323) at Lyft. These gatherings are designed to instigate conversation around the future of cities and living through the lens of architecture, mobility, community-building, real estate, design, and culture.

Our most recent salon was held in collaboration with [Enorme Studio](https://enormestudio.es) who presented ideas on how to live largely in smaller spaces using flexible, movable walls & furniture.
