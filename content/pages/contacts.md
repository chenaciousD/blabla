In addition my day job, I'm also working on several side projects that I would love your input on!

## Urban Salons to Instigate Scenius
In 2019, I began hosting  multi-disipinary salons in collaboration with Mat Chow at IDEO, Rebecca Blum at Lyft, discussing the future of cities through the lens of architecture, mobility, community-building,real estate, design, technology, and culture. 

The first salon was held in collaboration with [Enorme Studio](https://enormestudio.es).

Let me know you would like to attend one or if you would like to present your work or ideas to instigate conversation:

Topics of Particular Interest
+ Cities without cars
+ Flexible spaces
+ Post-suburbia
+ Intergenerational Housing
+ Radical property markets and rights
+ The Intersection of Digital & Physical UX - how digital communities cna learn from centuries of placemaking

## Coding

I've been teaching myself to code recently.

+ This site was built on JAMstack, using GatsbyJS as a static site generator, React for the UI and Netlify for CMS and CDN.
